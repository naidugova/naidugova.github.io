                    Hello, nice to see you here. I am from Tirupati,Andhra Pradesh. I am persuing my B-tech in computer science and engineering from Lovely Professional University,Punjab. I am in my 2nd year now. My social media links are provided below. This is my portfolio and you will find links to my projects and other certifications here.
                    <br>
                    My journey in B-tech started with confusion, I dont't know what is programming and C language is introduced in my 1st sem. Slowly, I started with programming and  started exploring career paths in computer science. In this journey I met many people and I mentioned their profiles also. Soon i will make this as a platform for new students to clear their doubts and seniors to share their experience and help others.
